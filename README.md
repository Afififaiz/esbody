1.	Introduction
Achieving a fit and muscular physique has become a common goal for many men and women in today's society. However, for those who are new to fitness, determining the right caloric intake and macronutrient balance can be a confusing and overwhelming task. It's important to determine whether one should be in a caloric surplus or deficit in order to build muscle, but this can be difficult to do without proper guidance. In addition, people often do not know what amounts of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats they should take in daily to achieve their desired body shape goals.
The importance of a balanced diet cannot be overstated, as the right balance of macronutrients is essential for both optimal muscle growth and overall health. However, despite the crucial role that diet plays in reaching fitness goals, many individuals struggle to determine the right balance for their needs. This problem is compounded by the overwhelming amount of information available online, which can often lead to confusion and misinformation.
To help these individuals overcome these challenges, it's important to provide a solution that can guide them in determining their caloric intake and macronutrient balance, and help them monitor their progress along the way. This is where our focus comes in - to create a solution that will simplify the process and make it easier for men and women to reach their fitness goals.


1.1 Problem statement 
We aim to develop an expert system to help men and women on their fitness journey. The system will focus on monitoring their calorie intake and macro-nutrient consumption, allowing individuals to track and understand the amount of macronutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats they are consuming. This expert system will provide a solution to effectively manage their diet and reach their desired body shape goals, making their journey easier and more manageable.

2.	Methodology for knowledge acquisition and representation
2.1	Knowledge acquisition

A crucial aspect of acquiring education is obtaining knowledge from multiple sources such as textbooks, guides, and case studies, among others. For our project, we consulted with specialists in the field through interviews. One of the interviews was with Asst. Prof. Dr Nor Azwani Bin Mohd Shukri a lecturer teaching basic medical nutrition therapy, nutrition support assessment from the International Islamic University Malaysia (UIA). We found the information gathered from this interview to be beneficial. Additionally, we researched diet and nutrition through articles on reputable websites. As a result, we developed a system that calculates the user's BMI and BMR to determine their desired fitness goal of cutting or bulking.

Question 	Answer 
1.	What does it mean by calorie intake? 	Calorie intake refers to the amount of calories consumed through food and beverages. The number of calories a person needs can vary depending on their age, gender, weight, and activity level. A calorie is a unit of measurement for energy and is often used to measure the energy content of foods. Consuming too many calories can lead to weight gain and an increased risk of health problems, while consuming too few calories can lead to weight loss and malnutrition. It's important to maintain a balance of calorie intake with energy expended.

2.	How many calories do we need to build our body? 	The number of calories needed to build the body can vary depending on an individual's age, sex, weight, height, and activity level. Generally, men need more calories than women due to their typically larger muscle mass. The recommended daily calorie intake for adult men is around 2,500 calories, while for adult women it is around 2,000 calories. However, active individuals, such as athletes or those who engage in regular intense physical activity, may require more calories to support muscle growth and repair.  

3.	How to count calorie intake? 	There are several ways to count calorie intake, including:  
●	Using a food diary: Write down everything you eat and drink throughout the day, along with the portion sizes and calorie counts. Many apps and websites can help you track your calories and provide you with a breakdown of the macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein, and fat) you are consuming. 
●	Reading nutrition labels: Most packaged foods have a nutrition label that lists the number of calories per serving. Be sure to check the serving size and adjust accordingly if you eat more or less than the recommended serving size. 
●	Consult a dietitian: if you need help counting calories, you can also talk to a dietitian. They will be able to help you figure out how many calories you should be eating each day based on your age, sex, weight, and activity level. They can also help you plan meals that are balanced and nutritious. 
It's important to note that counting calories is not the only way to maintain a healthy diet, and it's not the only factor that determines weight loss or gain. The quality of the food, eating habits, and physical activity all play a role.  

4.	How many meals per day for bodybuilders need to take? 	Bodybuilders typically eat several small meals throughout the day to help support muscle growth and repair. This is known as "meal frequency" or "eating frequency", the idea is that by eating small, frequent meals, the body is constantly supplied with the nutrients it needs to build and repair muscle tissue. The number of meals that bodybuilders need to eat per day can vary, but generally, it is recommended to eat at least 4-6 small, nutrient-dense meals per day. These meals should be high in protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates to provide the body with the necessary nutrients for muscle growth and repair.  

5.	What are the best bodybuilding food? 	Bodybuilders typically focus on consuming high-protein foods, such as lean meats, fish, eggs, and dairy products, to support muscle growth and repair. Complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, oatmeal, and quinoa, are also important for providing energy during workouts. Fruits and vegetables are also recommended for their nutrient content and antioxidant properties. Additionally, healthy fats, such as those found in nuts and avocados, can help with hormone production and cell growth. It's also important to stay hydrated by drinking enough water.  

6.	What should they eat after workout? 	After a workout, bodybuilders typically aim to consume a combination of protein and carbohydrates to support muscle recovery and replenish glycogen stores. A good post-workout meal or snack may include a source of lean protein, such as chicken, fish, or a protein shake, and a source of carbohydrates, such as sweet potatoes, brown rice, or fruit. Consuming protein and carbohydrates within 30 minutes to an hour after working out can help to improve muscle recovery and growth. Additionally, it's important to rehydrate with water or a sports drink after a workout to replace fluids lost through sweat.

7.	What should they eat before workout? 	Before working out, bodybuilders typically aim to consume a meal or snack that is high in carbohydrates and moderate in protein. Carbohydrates are important for providing energy during the workout, while protein helps to support muscle recovery and growth. A good pre-workout meal may include a source of complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains, fruit, or vegetables, and a source of lean protein, such as chicken, fish, or eggs.  

8.	Which nutrients are used for bodybuilding? 	Bodybuilding requires a balance of several key nutrients to support muscle growth, recovery, and overall health.  
Protein is essential for building and repairing muscle tissue, and can be found in a variety of foods such as lean meats, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Carbohydrates are important for providing energy during workouts and to replenish glycogen stores in the muscles. Whole grains, fruits, and vegetables are good sources of carbohydrates.  
Fats are also an important nutrient for bodybuilders, as they help to support hormone production and cell growth. Healthy fats can be found in foods such as nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil.  
Vitamins and minerals, such as Vitamin D, calcium, and iron are important for overall health and maintaining strong bones. Vitamin D can be obtained through sun exposure, and also can be found in fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified milk, and calcium can be found in dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified foods. Iron can be found in red meat, poultry, beans, leafy greens, and fortified cereals.  
Additionally, bodybuilders should pay attention to their hydration, drinking enough water throughout the day to maintain proper fluid balance and support overall health.  

9.	Is body fat necessary? 	Body fat is not strictly necessary for bodybuilders, but it is important to maintain a healthy level of body fat for overall health and well-being. A certain level of body fat is necessary for the body to function properly, and too low a body fat percentage can lead to health problems such as hormonal imbalances and nutrient deficiencies.  

10.	What fats are good for bodybuilding? 	There are several types of fats that can be beneficial for bodybuilding:  
●	Monounsaturated fats: These are found in foods such as avocados, olive oil, and nuts, and can help to improve blood cholesterol levels and reduce inflammation. 
●	Polyunsaturated fats: These are found in foods such as fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel), flaxseeds, and chia seeds, and can help to improve heart health and decrease inflammation in the body. 
●	Omega-3 fatty acids: These are a type of polyunsaturated fat found in fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel, and can help to improve heart health and decrease inflammation in the body. 
●	It's important to note that while these fats can be beneficial, they should be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet. A diet too high in fats can lead to health problems such as obesity and heart disease. It's always best to consult a registered dietitian or a certified strength and conditioning coach to help you create a sustainable and healthy diet and workout program that's tailored to your needs and goals.  

11.	What does "eating clean" mean? 	"Eating clean" is a term that is often used in the context of bodybuilding and fitness, and refers to a type of diet that focuses on consuming whole, unprocessed foods. The idea behind eating clean is that by consuming whole foods that are free of additives and preservatives, you can better control the quality and quantity of the nutrients that you are consuming, which can help to support muscle growth and recovery. A clean eating diet typically includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. It encourages to avoid processed foods, added sugars, and saturated and trans fats. The goal is to eat foods that are as close to their natural state as possible. Clean eating is often associated with a reduction in the consumption of processed foods, added sugars and saturated fats. 

12.	Why does every bodybuilders always mention about protein? 	Protein is a crucial nutrient for bodybuilders, as it is essential for building and repairing muscle tissue. When you lift weights, you create tiny tears in your muscle fibers. In order for those fibers to repair and grow, they need protein. The body uses amino acids, the building blocks of protein, to create new muscle fibers and repair existing ones. Protein is also essential for maintaining muscle mass, especially as we age. As we get older, muscle mass decreases, which can lead to a decrease in strength, mobility and overall health. Consuming adequate amounts of protein can help to slow down this process and maintain muscle mass.  

13.	How much protein does a bodybuilder need? 	The amount of protein a bodybuilder needs can vary depending on their individual needs and goals. However, generally speaking, bodybuilders typically require more protein than the average person to support muscle growth and repair. For example, a bodybuilder who weighs 80 kg would need approximately 96-160 grams of protein per day. It's important to note that this is just a general guideline and individual needs can vary depending on factors such as age, sex, activity level, and muscle mass. It's always best to consult a registered dietitian or a certified strength and conditioning coach to help you create a sustainable and healthy diet and workout program that's tailored to your needs and goals.  

14.	Is carbohydrate have anything to do with bodybuilding? 	Carbohydrates play an important role in bodybuilding as they are the primary source of fuel for the body during intense physical activity such as weightlifting. Carbohydrates are also necessary for the body to replenish glycogen stores in the muscles, which are depleted during exercise. However, the amount of carbohydrates needed will vary depending on the individual's training regimen and goals. It is important for bodybuilders to consult a nutritionist or dietitian to determine the appropriate amount of carbohydrates for their specific needs.
